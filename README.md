# Cloudflare AI Motivational Assistant üß†

This project delivers a dynamic and intelligent motivational quote generator, leveraging the power of Google's Generative AI within a robust Cloudflare Worker backend. It's designed to provide personalized uplifting messages based on user mood, all served through a modern, responsive frontend built with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. Get ready to receive that perfectly tailored boost of inspiration! ‚ú®

## üöÄ Installation

Getting this project up and running locally is straightforward. Just follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonatee/my-tailwind-ts-project.git
cd my-tailwind-ts-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Google Generative AI API Key

This project relies on the Google Generative AI API. You'll need to obtain an API key and configure it for your Cloudflare Worker.

*   üåê **Get your API Key**: Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) to obtain your `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`.
*   üîë **Configure for Cloudflare Worker**:
    For local development with `wrangler dev`, you can create a `.dev.vars` file in the project root:

    ```
    GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    For deployment to Cloudflare, you'll set this as a secret:

    ```bash
    wrangler secret put GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY
    # Paste your API key when prompted
    ```

### 4. Adjust Frontend API Endpoint (for Local Development)

The frontend `src/index.ts` currently points to a deployed Cloudflare Worker URL. For local development, you'll want it to call your local `wrangler dev` instance.

*   üìÇ **Open `src/index.ts`**: Locate the `fetch` call within the `generateQuotes` function.
*   ‚úèÔ∏è **Modify the URL**: Change the hardcoded URL to point to your local Cloudflare Worker development server. Typically, this will be `http://127.0.0.1:8787/generate-quote` or `http://localhost:8787/generate-quote`.

    ```typescript
    // Replace with your Cloudflare Worker local development URL
    const res = await fetch(
      "http://localhost:8787/generate-quote", // <--- Change this line
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ mood }),
      }
    );
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed and configured, you can run and interact with the application:

### 1. Start the Tailwind CSS Watcher

Open your first terminal and run the build command. This will compile your Tailwind CSS and watch for changes, ensuring your styles are always up-to-date.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Start the Cloudflare Worker Development Server

Open a second terminal and start the Cloudflare Worker. This will serve your frontend files and expose the backend API for quote generation.

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs `wrangler dev`, which will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8787`). Open this URL in your web browser.

### 3. Interact with the Application

*   You'll see a simple web interface with a text area.
*   **Enter your current mood** (e.g., "happy", "stressed", "feeling neutral", "excited") into the text area.
*   **Click the "Generate Quote" button** (or similar, depending on the frontend design).
*   The application will send your mood to the Cloudflare Worker, which uses Google GenAI to craft a personalized motivational message.
*   The generated quote will then be displayed on the screen.
*   You can close the quote panel and generate new quotes as desired.

### 4. Deploy to Cloudflare (Optional)

If you wish to deploy your worker to Cloudflare, ensure you've run `wrangler login` and then execute:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Remember to revert the `src/index.ts` API endpoint change back to your deployed Cloudflare Worker URL if you plan to use the deployed frontend with the deployed backend.
